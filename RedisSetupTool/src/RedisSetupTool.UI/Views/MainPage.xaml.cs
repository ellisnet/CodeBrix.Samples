/// <b>Shell shape: sibling grids switched by Visibility, rather than a nested Frame.</b>
/// A spike was run on the Linux X11 head and a nested <c>Frame</c> works — three
/// navigations succeeded, each page constructed, loaded and sized correctly (816x640), and a
/// nested page's own <c>Page.DataContext</c> resolved. Sibling grids were chosen anyway, for two
/// reasons the spike also showed:
/// </para>
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><description>A <c>Frame</c> constructs a fresh page — and therefore a fresh view model
/// — on every navigation, including a return to a page already visited. This tool's sections
/// hold live state: an open console session, a running stats stream, a half-filled create form.
/// All of it would be discarded on every rail click.</description></item>
/// <item><description>Navigating away unloads the section's visual tree. <c>TerminalControl</c>
/// silently drops anything fed to it before <c>Loaded</c>, so a console tab would lose output
/// while the user looked at another section. A second spike proved the alternative works: a
/// <c>TerminalControl</c> created inside a <b>collapsed</b> grid raises <c>Loaded</c> only when
/// that grid becomes visible, and keeps its grid size and content afterwards.</description></item>
/// </list>
/// <para>
/// The section markup is self-contained either way, so the choice stays reversible.
/// </para>
